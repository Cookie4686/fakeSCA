**Version 0.1**

**Context** -2024 November (6 months after last commits)

This is a fake website of my previous high school (SCA) which I made for fun.
The main purpose is to practice using Svelte+SvelteKit.
I worked on this for a while until I stopped because I went to practice working with database.

But I might continue this project in the future,
mainly to migrate it from Svelte4 to Svelte5.
